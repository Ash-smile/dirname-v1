`dirname` returns the directory path of the current module, while `__dirname` returns the full file path of the module.

npm install dirname-v1
```


## Declaration

```

For es6 module =>

```js
import { dirname, __dirname } from 'dirname-v1';
```

## Example Usage

```

```js
import {readerSync} from 'fs'
const filepath = __dirname + "/file";
